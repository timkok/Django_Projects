### 1. Automatic Tweets Posting

**Project idea –** building a bot to automatically post tweets using the Twitter API or another API to randomly get quotes, funny lines, etc to post on Twitter. 

1. Django would typically be the interface to the bot in this situation, with some scheduled task performing the bot's actions. This is doable, I'd recommend making a view of the bot's status before the midterm and a view where you can submit a new action or something to say to the bot for the final. 

### 2. Todo App in Django

**Project idea –** In a todo app, a user can keep track of all the things he/she is planning to do and create a list. They can then update the list when the task is completed. Build a nice app with basic Html, CSS, and JavaScript and host on the localhost server using Django framework.

2. This is a pretty standard getting started task. I'd recommend making a view that shows the TODO list items before the midterm and a view that allows people to add an item before the final. 

### 3. Blog Web App

**Project idea –** Customize the design of the blog to match the blog’s theme and provide the functionality to add a blog for the admin and other viewers can read blogs and post comments.

3. You could work on this too, I'd focus on something that displays and article or maybe a list of articles before the midterm and something that allows you to ost an article or comments before the final. 

### 4. Integrating Plotly Dash in Django

**Project idea –** Plotly Dash is the most popular framework to build an interactive dashboard in python. Building a web application using Django framework specifically for an interactive dashboard.

4. This could be tricky, but doable. It should mostly be a matter of seeing how to fold Plotly into your templates. If you decide to try this out, I'd ask for two views showing data from your Django database using Plotly.
